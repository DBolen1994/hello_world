Tutorial

Many miles away from home, steps are difficult I'm exhausted.
But I did not fall, I hope, something good is coming up.

Free like a bird, but also bound.
Look at my footsteps on the ground.
I raise my head, listen to the sound.
I'm happy with what I have found.

Just breathe, just breathe.
Just breathe, just breathe.
